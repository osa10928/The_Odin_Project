# The Odin Project Projects

This repository features most of the work I completed as I worked through The Odin Project. Work done in this repository was done from Dec 2016 until March 2017 (before The Odin Project switched its focus from Ruby to Node)
The projects on this repos contain 3 main folders. Ruby, Rails Work Space, and Sinatra. It also contains a sketchpad folder which was my introduction to the Frontend.

## Ruby
The ruby folder contains projects and algorithms I completed as I learned my first programming language: Ruby.
The alogrithms are simple but the games were a bit more complex and downright interesting. Most of them way for fun to make they were complicated and the all can be run via the command line.
(Note: The command line chess contains all the rules except for the rule where there can be a stalemate at the end if a single king isn't captured under 20 or 25 turns. I wasn't aware of the rule at the time...)

## Rails Workspace
This folder contains different rails apps. Each one ment to teach me a particular lesson or another about rails but none an application in completion. I keep it around to help me go back and relearn things about rails, but I doubt this folder will be any good for outside eyes.
(To see an application I made with rails to completion view my 'Flight' Booker repo)

## Sinatra
This folder features applications I made with Sinatra. Sinatra was used a precusor to learning Rails and helped glues the Ruby language to application development.

## Goals
The goal of this repo is acutally more personal than it is professional. Looking back at these projects let me know how far I've come from a fledgling coder to what I am now.
And besides creating an indepth Rails application or remaking command line chess, none of these files would be hard for me to recreate now. But looking at what I was able to do with Ruby, staying up at all hours of the night just to write a few more lines of code... nostalgia.

## Special Thanks
Thanks everyone who read this. I know this was semi-unprofessional and probably not what you expected but I hoped you enjoyed anyway. If you didn't... relax, its just one repo.
I'd also like to give the biggest thanks possible to the people at The Odin Project for providing a free method for me to become addicted to coding and starting me on this thrilling journey that I am still completing. Love and Peace to all!
